This project is a practice on QML with C++ integration

In the background, C++ is running with a timer module.

The UI will display actions which a user can use to manipulate the C++ timer in the background.

It is built upon QML for Beginners Lesson on Udemy by Bryan Cairns - Section 11: QML and C++ integration - C++ integration example


Important notes when making changes to the code:
- If something does not seem to work well with the timer, consider doing a CLEAN ALL for the project before re-building the code and running it.
